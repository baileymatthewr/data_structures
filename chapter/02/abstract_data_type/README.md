# Abstract Data Types and C++ Classes

## Throttle Class

This example of the Throttle Class is an introduction to classes used for
something semi-abstract. It doesn't exist on it's own and must be used in a
particular circumstance. The example shows that classes don't explicitly need
a constructor in order to be run. Also, many improvements can be made for the
sake of learning about the classes in regards to C++. As PHP is also used in
my exploration, a default constructor appears to be in play implicitly
