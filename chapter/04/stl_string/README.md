## Strings

Strings showcase the reason why most languages choose to make strings immutable
objects. As arrays generally use contiguous memory, you have 2 choices with how
a string might work. There is the worst-case length approach where you allow a
string to change in place or a heap-stored single use array. There's no clear
answer on why one is better than the other, but languages and programmers seem
to prefer the latter option.
