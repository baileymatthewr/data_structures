# The Bag Structure

## About

The bag structure is a basic container with little functionality. The idea with
using this structure is to help one understand the basic concept of a
container. You can put things inside it. You can also remove things from it. You
can also count up how many of a certain thing there are. You can remove a single
item. You can remove all of a certain thing. In the case of C++, which is
discussed heavily in this book, you must maintain items of the same type in this
bag.
