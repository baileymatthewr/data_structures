##The Bag Structure

### About

The bag structure is a basic container with little functionality. The idea with
using this structure is to help one understand the basic concept of a
container. You can put things inside it. You can also remove things from it.
You can also count up how many of a certain thing there are. You can remove a
single item. You can remove all of a certain thing. In the case of C++, which
is discussed heavily in this book, you must maintain items of the same type in
this bag.

##The Sequence Structure

A sequence is similar to a bag, in that it is a container, but provides a bit
more functionality. The 'sequence' name hints at the order being of importance.
The functionality provided to this particular structure deals with that order.
The concept of an iterator is introduced--not fully completed--but gives an idea
of why iterators are useful and how they can help with more complex and structured
designs.
