# data_structures
An independent study of data structures as described in "4th Edition Data Structures and Other Objects Using C++" adapted for PHP. 

## notes
1. Examples from the book are used, completed but modified to explore the structures. 
2. Some liberties are taken in terms of how the code is written style-wise. 
3. Adaptations to PHP help one better understand the structures and, in turn, the differences between a strongly typed language and a duck typed language.
4. Additional notes on topics are included with links to the published Google Slides as seen in other READMEs throughout the repo.
5. Contributors are welcome, but must follow standard GitHub (issue, branching, pull request, etc.) etiquette. Send me an email at bailey.matthewr@gmail.com.
